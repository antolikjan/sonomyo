The tongue-at-rest position describes the position of the tongue outside of any activity. Throughout the day (and night), the tongue is one of the busiest parts of our body. We use it for speech, but also for chewing, swallowing food, drinks, and saliva. The quality and effectiveness of speaking, chewing, and swallowing greatly depend on tongue activity. However, the tongue has a very important function even when it doesn’t do anything - at rest.

At rest, the tongue should be in a relaxed position, supported with the palate, gently closed lips, and accompanied by nasal breathing.

What it should feel/look like:

* **Tongue tip**: Tongue tip lightly touches the little ridge just behind your upper front teeth (the alveolar ridge). Importantly, it does not touch the teeth.
* **Tongue body**: The front third to half of the tongue body rest up against the roof of your mouth (the palate), like a gentle suction.
* **Tongue sides**: The sides of the tongue rest softly against the lower edge of the upper palate at the border with the upper molars area. This is a gentle contact, not force.
* **Jaw and teeth**: Jaw is relaxed. Teeth are slightly apart  or very lightly touching in some people. Again, there is no strong pressing.
* **Lips**: Lips are closed and relaxed.
* **Breathing**: Through the nose, quiet and easy.
